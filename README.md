# Predicting Market Size of Ireland Tourism

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the market size of Ireland tourism using machine learning techniques. The predictions generated by this model will be utilized to inform decision-making processes for investments in subsequent years' budgets. The project is undertaken as part of coursework for CCT Dublin College.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the market size of Ireland tourism. By leveraging historical data and various features relevant to tourism trends, the model seeks to provide insights into the future trajectory of tourism activity in Ireland. These insights will facilitate informed decision-making regarding budget allocations for investments in the tourism sector.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises historical data related to tourism activities in Ireland. It includes various features such as tourist arrivals, expenditure, accommodation statistics, economic indicators, and other relevant factors. The dataset is preprocessed and prepared for machine learning model training and evaluation.

## Methodology

The project follows a typical machine learning workflow, which includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and patterns that may exist within the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and engineering relevant features that may improve the predictive performance of the model.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluating various machine learning algorithms suitable for regression tasks and selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
5. **Model Training**: Training the selected model on the preprocessed dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
7. **Prediction**: Generating predictions for future market sizes of Ireland tourism based on the trained model.
8. **Deployment**: Integrating the model into decision-making processes for budget allocations.
